## Summary ##
A cross-platform application to provide smart task delegation to team members.

## Problem Statement ##
In a team environment, the assignment of tasks can be tedious and difficult for management. With different team members possessing different skills in different areas of the team’s responsibilities and specialties, certain team members will be better suited to tackle different tasks. Keeping this in mind, the project will consist of a cross-platform application that will allow for teams to quickly coordinate and delegate tasks assigned to the team.


## General Project Scope ##
This project will cover implementation of two different types of applications: desktop and mobile. The desktop application will be developed for the macOS operating system and the mobile application developed for iOS. In addition to the front end development, the project will cover creation of a shared backend (model) and a shared database (Firebase) for the two front-end implementations. Lastly, the project will have an intelligent algorithm to determine recommended tasks for team members based on the success of previous tasks.


## Project Timeline and Milestones ##
- November, 2017 – Initial project proposal and course approval for start in Winter quarter, 2018.
- December, 2017 – Background research and gathering resources for starting project.
- January, 2018 – Data design and creation, initialize Firebase models/data and project backend.
- January to February, 2018 – iOS application design and implementation.
- March, 2018 – macOS application design and implementation.
- April, 2018 – Implementation of artificial intelligence recommendation algorithms.
- May, 2018 – Complete written report of project and document project implementation.
- June, 2018 – Finalization of project details and submission of project to advisor and the library.


## Satisfaction of Senior Project Requirements ##
The following outlines the requirements that will be met with the following specifics.

### Time Commitment ###
This project is estimated to take 200–250 hours of work, based on the calculation of 10–12 hours of work per week over 2 quarters of 10 weeks each. 

### Independence ###
The project provides a learning experience on the production of a large-scale software application independent from other projects, with completion when the applications are fully functioning.

### Background Research ###
As the implementation the project requires the use of new programming languages, extensive background research is needed to achieve completion. 

### Ownership ###
As the sole individual responsible for the success of the project, the project creates accountability by requiring myself to complete all aspects outlined in this proposal. 

### Creativity ###
The user-interface and design of the application will require the creative use of computer and mobile applications to achieve project completion with a user-centered design that offers easy usability and functionality, a main requirement for the project.
